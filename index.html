    <article id="articles1">My name is Harsh Raj, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree at I.I.I.T Kalyani. Academics have always been an integral part of my journey, and I take pride in the milestones I have achieved so far, such as scoring 95.33% in 10th grade and 91.33% in 12th grade. My educational journey began at Kendriya Vidyalaya Danapur, which shaped my values and instilled in me a sense of discipline and curiosity.Outside academics, I am a multifaceted individual with diverse interests and talents. I am passionate about hockey and have not only played the sport but also had the privilege of leading my team as captain. This experience has taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and leadership.
    I also have a keen interest in technology, particularly web development and ethical hacking, as I believe these skills are crucial in today’s digital world. My curiosity drives me to learn new things and continuously improve myself. Whether it’s coding, designing, or researching, I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and determination.In the future, I aspire to combine my technical skills, creativity, and leadership qualities to make a meaningful impact in my field and inspire others to chase their dreams. My journey is ongoing, and I look forward to exploring the endless possibilities life has to offer.</article>
